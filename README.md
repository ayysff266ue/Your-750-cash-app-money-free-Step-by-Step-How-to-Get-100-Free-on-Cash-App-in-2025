Protect Yourself from Scams
Using Cash App to earn and manage money can be incredibly convenient, but it‚Äôs essential to stay vigilant to avoid scams. Here are some key safety tips:

Be Selective with Your $Cashtag: Only share your $Cashtag with trusted individuals. Scammers may try to contact you, posing as Cash App representatives or other users, but remember that your $Cashtag should only be shared with people you know or legitimate customers if you‚Äôre running a business.
